    <h1>README for cache manager</h1>
<h2>CREDITS:</h2>
<p>This class is made by unreal4u (Camilo Sperberg). <a href="http://unreal4u.com/">unreal4u.com</a></p>

<h2>ABOUT THIS CLASS:</h2>
<h3>In a glinch:</h3>
<ul><li>Can be used to cache different things</li>
    <li>Anything you choose, it will cache.</li>
    <li>Change quickly from one type of cache to another (Included: file and APC).</li>
    <li>Write your own wrappers!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Detailed:</h3>
<p>This package will use the cache engine of your choice to save things to cache.<br /><br />

There are many other very good engines out there (ZendCache / fluxBB-cache) that are probably better but this one is
made with speed, ease of use and stability in mind. It will also give you the capability to write your very own cache
mechanism and implement it very quickly as all calls are identical.<br /><br /> 

This package has been extensivily tested with xdebug, APC and Suhosin so that no errors are present.</p>

<h2>USAGE:</h2>
<ul><li>This class was made with simplicity, speed and security in mind:<br>

<pre>include('cacheManager.class.php'); // Please see below for explanation
try {
    $cache = new cacheManagerClass('apc', true);
} catch (CacheException $e) {
    print('Exception caught! Message: "'.$e->getMessage().'"');
}
$secondExample = $cache->load('secondExample', array('en_US'));
// Cache isn't loaded, so create it:
if (empty($secondExample)) {
    $secondExample = 'Some very long process that would be useful to cache';
    // Save for 120 seconds
    $cache->save($secondExample, 'secondExample', null, 120);
}
</pre></li>
    </li>
    <li>Congratulations! Everything is now properly saved in cache! Sit back and watch your server going nuts serving requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Please see examples for more options and advanced usage</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>PENDING:</h2>
