* *Automatic-DB-Updater_v0.1*: Outdated class. Will not be updated anymore.
* *cacheManager_v2.0*: Outdated class. See cacheManager_v2.1
* *cacheManager_v2.1*: This class will enable you to use APC or file based cache module based on a name and a few
  arguments. Changing between these cache types is just a matter of changing the constructor call, from
  `new cacheManager('apc');` to `new cacheManager('your-type');`. You can additionally write your own wrappers, just
  implement the interface and extend the base class and you're good to go!
